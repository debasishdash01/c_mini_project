The for loop gathers all three actions (initializing, testing, and updating) into one place.
The for statement uses three control expressions, separated by semicolons, to control a
looping process. The initialize expression is executed once, before any of the loop statements
are executed. Then the test expression is evaluated and, if it is true (or nonzero), the
loop is cycled through once. Then the update expression is evaluated, and it is time to check
the test expression again. The for statement is an entry-condition loop—the decision to go
through one more pass of the loop is made before the loop is traversed. Therefore, it is possible
that the loop is never traversed. The statement part of the form can be a simple statement
or a compound statement.

The syntax of a for loop in C programming language is -

for ( init; condition; increment )
{
   statement(s);
}

The loop is repeated until test becomes false or zero.
