The while loop is a conditional loop using an entry condition. It is called “conditional” because
the execution of the statement portion depends on the condition described by the test expression.
The expression is an entry condition because the condition must be
met before the body of the loop is entered.
while ( expression )
statement
The statement portion is repeated until the expression becomes false or 0.

Examples:
while (n++ < 100)
printf(" %d %d\n",n, 2 * n + 1); // single statement
while (fargo < 1000)
{ // compound statement
fargo = fargo + step;
step = 2 * step;
}
