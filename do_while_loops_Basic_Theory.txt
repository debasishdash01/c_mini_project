The while loop and the for loop are both entry-condition loops. The test condition is checked
before each iteration of the loop, so it is possible for the statements in the loop to never
execute. C also has an exit-condition loop, in which the condition is checked after each iteration
of the loop, guaranteeing that statements are executed at least once. This variety is called a
do while loop.
Here is the general form of the do while loop:
do
statement
while ( expression );
The statement can be simple or compound. Note that the do while loop itself counts as a
statement and, therefore, requires a terminating semicolon.
