The versatility of the computer lies in its ability to perform a set of
instructions repeatedly. This involves repeating some portion of
the program either a specified number of times or until a particular
condition is being satisfied. This repetitive operation is done through a loop control instructions.
There are three methods:
 a)Using for Loop
 b)Using a while Loop
 c)Using a do-while Loop
